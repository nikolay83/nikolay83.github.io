I changed the input data (all home, details, redeem page data now in businesses.json).
For the first entry added 2 redeem values.

The only issue I worry about is #5 android canâ€™t scan qr code. I improved the performance here, and it works well on
my Nexus 4. I hope, it will be work everywhere, but I not sure. If you still can't scan the code, please let me know
what image you scan and what device you use. I have try it with some different images, both printed and from screen.
For example, the qr code from redeem page scans well from monitor screen. Please try to move your phone closer slowly
from distant 30-40cm.
